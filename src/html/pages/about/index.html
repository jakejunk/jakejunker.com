					<p>Hey! Name's Jake. I'm currently a Computer Science major at Oklahoma State, looking to graduate by May 2017. I've always been the type to take interest in things with flashing lights and bright colors, as long as I get to put it together myself. I began programming when I was 18 &#8212; creating games in frameworks such as <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA">XNA</a> &#8212; and gained an interest in web design somewhere along the way. Nowadays, you can find me working on front-end UI, game engine architecture, or playing around with a Raspberry Pi. My language of choice right now is probably <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>, although I'm not afraid to take the <span title="Hold my segfault, I'm going in!">plunge</span> into a C/C++ codebase.</p>
					<p>Other interests of mine include drawing, hiking, watching <span title="Go Broncos!">football</span>, and admiring planes as they fly overhead. I like keeping myself active by participating in mud-runs or playing rugby, but I really just like doing anything where I get an excuse to run. Walking on the beach with my girlfriend is what I dream of doing everyday, and a good bowl of pasta will always put me in a great mood.</p>

					<img class="image-round inline-left" src="/include_/img/code-blur.png"/>
					<p>This webpage is all about learning! Sure, using a framework such as <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> would have made the development of this site much easier, but where's the fun in that? I've had a much better time trying to figure out things like rems or vertical margin collapsing by myself*.</p>

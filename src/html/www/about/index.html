					<h2 class="center-align">About me</h2>
					<img class="image-round inline-left" src="/_include/img/me/headshot-overseas.jpg" alt="Picture of me."/>
					<p>I'm Jake, a recent computer science graduate and aspiring software engineer. I've always been the type to take interest in things with flashing lights and bright colors, as long as I get to put it together myself. I began programming when I was 18&#8212;creating games in frameworks such as <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA">XNA</a>&#8212;and gained an interest in web design somewhere along the way. Nowadays, I can be found working on front-end UI, game engine architecture, or playing around with a Raspberry Pi. My language of choice at the moment is probably <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>, although I'm not afraid of diving into a C/C++ codebase.</p>
					<p>Other interests of mine include various <span title="Go Broncos!">sports</span> and hiking, which mostly balance out my other computer-based hobbies. I enjoy trying to learn foreign languages, and I dream of getting a pilot's license and traveling the world. Someday...</p>

					<h2 class="center-align">About this site</h2>
					<img class="image-round inline-right" src="/_include/img/code-blur.jpg" alt="Picture of code."/>
					<p>This website is all about learning the hard way. Using a framework like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> could've made development much easier, but where's the fun in that? Working on this site by myself<sup>1</sup> has led to some incredible learning experiences, and will hopefully continue to do so in the future. On a similar note, new up-and-coming technologies such as <a href="http://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> are always welcome here, and will probably be used overzealously. I'll try not to break the site <i>too</i> often, I promise.</p>
					<p>In the spirit of learning, I've created a few "guidelines" for this site to abide by, which you can read about on the page linked below. Additionally, all source code relating to this site and its development can be viewed on GitHub.</p>

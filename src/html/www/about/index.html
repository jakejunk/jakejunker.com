					<h1>About</h1>

					<p>Hey! My name is Jake, and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Oklahoma State. I've always been the type to take interest in things with flashing lights and bright colors, as long as I get to put it together myself. I began programming when I was 18&#8212;creating games in frameworks such as <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA">XNA</a>&#8212;and gained an interest in web design somewhere along the way. Nowadays, you can find me working on front-end UI, game engine architecture, or playing around with a Raspberry Pi. My language of choice right now is probably <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>, although I'm not afraid to take the <span title="Hold my segfault, I'm going in!">plunge</span> into a C/C++ codebase.</p>
					<p>Other interests of mine include drawing, hiking, watching <span title="Go Broncos!">football</span>, and gazing at planes as they fly overhead. I like keeping myself active by participating in mud-runs or playing rugby, but I really just enjoy doing anything where I get an excuse to run. Climbing mountains is what I dream of doing everyday, and a good bowl of pasta will always put me in a great mood.</p>

					<h2 class="center-align">About this site</h2>
					<img class="image-round inline-right" src="/_include/img/code-blur.png" alt=""/>
					<p>This website is all about learning! Sure, using a framework such as <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> would have made the development of this site much easier, but where's the fun in that? I've had a much better time trying to figure out things like absolute positioning or vertical margin collapsing by myself<sup>1</sup>. Naturally, this site has become my personal tool for learning the nitty-gritty details of web development. Experimental technologies are always welcome here, and <b>will</b> be used with reckless abandon, so don't be too surprised when <a href="http://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> becomes the backbone of this page! I try not to break the site <i>too</i> much, but it happens every so often.</p>
					<p>In the spirit of learning, I've created a few "guidelines" for this site to abide by, which you can read about on the page linked below. Additionally, all source code relating to this site and its development can be viewed on GitHub. Feel free to stop on by!</p>
